# Readable Project

This project is for the final assessment in Udacity's Redux course where we build a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the server-side API under `/api-server`, and the code for the client-side application under `/client`.

## Running the project

* Install and start the API server:
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, start the client-side application:
    - `cd client`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## API Server README

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
